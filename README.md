## Introduction
In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a transformative paradigm, bridging the domains of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics to enable the creation of intelligent, adaptive, and autonomous systems. This textbook is designed to provide a comprehensive, in-depth introduction to the principles, techniques, and applications of deep reinforcement learning, empowering students, researchers, and practitioners to advance the state of the art in this rapidly evolving field. As the first DRL class I have taken was Prof. Levine's CS 294-112, this book's organization and materials are based strongly on the CS 294-112 (now CS 285)'s slides and syllabus.

The primary objective of this textbook is to offer a systematic and rigorous treatment of DRL, from foundational concepts and mathematical formulations to cutting-edge algorithms and practical implementations. We strive to strike a balance between theoretical clarity and practical relevance, providing readers with the knowledge and tools needed to develop novel DRL solutions for a wide array of real-world problems.

The textbook is organized into several parts, each dedicated to a specific aspect of DRL:

1. Fundamentals: This part covers the essential background material in reinforcement learning, including Markov decision processes, value functions, and fundamental algorithms such as Q-learning and policy gradients.
2. Deep Learning for Reinforcement Learning: Here, we delve into the integration of deep learning techniques with reinforcement learning, discussing topics such as function approximation, representation learning, and the use of deep neural networks as function approximators.
3. Advanced Techniques and Algorithms: This part presents state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, such as Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), along with their theoretical underpinnings and practical considerations.
4. Exploration and Exploitation: We explore strategies for balancing exploration and exploitation in DRL, examining methods such as intrinsic motivation, curiosity-driven learning, and Bayesian optimization.
5. Real-World Applications: This section showcases the application of DRL to various domains, including robotics, computer vision, natural language processing, and healthcare, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in each area.
Throughout the textbook, we supplement the theoretical exposition with practical examples, case studies, and programming exercises, allowing readers to gain hands-on experience in implementing DRL algorithms and applying them to diverse problems. We also provide references to relevant literature, guiding the reader towards further resources for deepening their understanding and pursuing advanced topics.

We envision this textbook as a valuable resource for students, researchers, and practitioners seeking a solid grounding in deep reinforcement learning, as well as a springboard for future innovation and discovery in this exciting and dynamic field. It is our hope that this work will contribute to the ongoing growth and development of DRL, facilitating the creation of intelligent systems that can learn, adapt, and thrive in complex, ever-changing environments.

We extend our deepest gratitude to our colleagues, reviewers, and students, whose invaluable feedback and insights have helped shape this textbook. We also wish to acknowledge the pioneering researchers whose contributions have laid the foundation for DRL and inspired us to embark on this journey.
